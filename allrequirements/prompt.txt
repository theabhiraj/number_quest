Project Overview:
Create a Flutter puzzle game app named "Puzzle Adventure" that dynamically fetches puzzles from a Firebase Realtime Database. The puzzles can be of varying grid sizes (e.g., 3×3, 4×3, 6×6). The app must display the puzzle, allow tile movements, show hints, and update the best time if the player beats the record. No login is required.


File Structure (Simplified):
/lib
  ├── main.dart                    // Entry point and Firebase initialization.
  ├── screens
  │     ├── home_screen.dart       // Lists available puzzles from Firebase.
  │     └── puzzle_screen.dart     // Displays the selected puzzle with its grid.
  ├── widgets
  │     ├── puzzle_grid.dart       // Dynamically builds the grid layout based opuzzle size.
  │     └── tile_widget.dart       // Represents individual puzzle tiles with tap/drag support.
  └── models
        └── puzzle.dart            // Puzzle model containing id, title, description, grid, solution, best_time, hints.

Frontend UI Components:

  - Home Screen (home_screen.dart):
      Purpose: Retrieve and list puzzles from Firebase.
      Components:
        A list or grid view of puzzle cards.
        Each card displays puzzle title, a brief description, and best time.
        Tapping a puzzle navigates to the Puzzle Screen.

  - Puzzle Screen (puzzle_screen.dart):
      Purpose: Render the puzzle details and interactive grid.
      Components:
        Display puzzle title and description.
        Show a dynamically generated grid using the PuzzleGrid widget.
        Display hints (if available) below the grid.
        A section to show current time and best time.
        A “Submit” or “Complete” button that triggers validation of the solution.

  - PuzzleGrid Widget (puzzle_grid.dart):
      Purpose: Build a grid layout that adapts to various sizes (e.g., 3×3, 4×3, 6×6).
      Components:
        Use a GridView or custom layout widget.
        Dynamically calculate the number of columns based on the puzzle grid data from Firebase.
        Populate the grid with TileWidget instances.

  - Tile Widget (tile_widget.dart):
      Purpose: Display individual puzzle pieces.
      Features:
        Support tap/drag functionality for moving tiles.
        Visually update when the tile is moved.

  - Styling & Interaction:
      Use simple animations for tile movement.
      Incorporate loading indicators while data is being fetched.
      Error messages for any Firebase connection issues.


Backend Operations:

  Fetching Data:
    On the Home Screen, fetch the list of puzzles.
    When a puzzle is selected, fetch the full puzzle details including grid size, hints, and best time.

  Dynamic Grid Handling:
    The grid data (2D array) defines the grid dimensions. The PuzzleGrid widget calculates rows and columns based on the data.

  Updating Best Time:
    After a puzzle is completed, compare the player's time with the stored best_time.
    If the player's time is lower, update the best_time field in Firebase.

  Firebase Setup:
    Use the firebase realtime database packages.
    Initialize Firebase in main.dart.
    Set up appropriate Firebase security rules to allow read access (and write access for updating best_time if needed) without user login. Consider anonymous authentication if security is a concern.



Additional Considerations:

  Error Handling:
    Provide feedback if the Firebase fetch fails. Include retry options or offline data caching.

  Responsiveness:
    Ensure the UI adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.

  Extensibility:
    The file structure and components should be modular, making it easier to add new features like different game modes or additional puzzle types in the future.

  Testing:
    Include basic unit tests for puzzle logic and widget tests for UI components.

  Documentation:
    Comment your code to explain the functionality of each component, especially the dynamic grid generation and Firebase interactions.
