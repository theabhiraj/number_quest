Sure! Here's a universal prompt that works for generating a perfect UI design for any type of app:

Prompt:
"Design a modern, user-friendly UI for a [type of app] that is visually appealing, responsive, and intuitive. The layout should be clean and well-structured, ensuring easy navigation and a seamless user experience. Use a color scheme that aligns with the app's purpose (e.g., professional for finance, vibrant for gaming, minimal for productivity). Implement smooth animations, microinteractions, and clear typography for readability. The interface should be optimized for both mobile and desktop, following accessibility standards for all users. Incorporate relevant UI components, such as interactive buttons, visually distinct icons, data visualization (if applicable), and engaging content presentation. Ensure the design is adaptive, supporting light and dark mode. The overall experience should feel natural, efficient, and engaging, encouraging users to interact effortlessly with the app."
