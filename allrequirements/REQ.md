# Number Quest - Comprehensive Specifications

## Application Overview
Number Quest is a puzzle game built with Flutter that challenges players to arrange numbered tiles in the correct order. The unique twist is that each puzzle contains two empty spaces instead of the traditional single space, adding strategic depth to the gameplay.

## Target Platforms
- Android
- iOS
- Web (potential future support)

## Core Features

### Puzzle Management
- 525 puzzles of varying difficulty and grid sizes
- Puzzles stored and retrieved from Firebase Realtime Database
- Progressive difficulty levels from beginner to expert
- Support for grid sizes: 2×2, 3×3, 4×4, 5×5, 6×6, and 7×7

### Gameplay Mechanics
- Dual empty space system for strategic movement
- Tile movement animation with smooth transitions
- Valid move detection and enforcement
- Solution verification algorithm
- Game state persistence between app sessions

### User Interface Components
- Home screen with puzzle selection interface
- Puzzle grid with responsive tile sizing
- Game information panel (time, moves, difficulty)
- Hint system with contextual tips
- Best time leaderboard
- Achievement tracking
- Settings menu for customization
- Tutorial for new players

### Visual Design
- Minimalist, clean aesthetic with focus on gameplay
- Color-coded difficulty levels
- Subtle animations for tile movement and completion
- Haptic feedback for tile movements
- Dynamic themes (light/dark mode)
- Accessibility features for color blindness

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Flutter
- **State Management**: Provider or Bloc pattern
- **Animation**: Flutter's built-in animation system
- **Layout**: Responsive design using MediaQuery and LayoutBuilder

### Backend
- **Database**: Firebase Realtime Database
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication (for leaderboards)
- **Analytics**: Firebase Analytics for user behavior tracking
- **Storage**: Local storage for game progress and settings

### Data Structures
- Puzzle data stored as JSON objects
- Grid representation using 2D arrays
- Move history stack for undo functionality
- User preferences stored in shared preferences

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: MVP
- Basic puzzle functionality with two empty spaces
- Firebase integration for puzzle retrieval
- Timer and move counter
- Basic UI implementation

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features
- User account system
- Leaderboards
- Achievement system
- Hint system
- Settings and customization

### Phase 3: Expansion
- Daily challenges
- Custom puzzle creator
- Social sharing features
- Advanced statistics

## UX Flow
1. **App Launch**: Splash screen → Home screen
2. **Puzzle Selection**: Browse puzzles by difficulty
3. **Gameplay**: Play selected puzzle with timer running
4. **Completion**: Celebration animation → Stats display → Return to selection or next puzzle
5. **Settings**: Accessible from home screen or during gameplay

## Monetization Possibilities
- Free with ads, premium ad-free version
- In-app purchases for hint packs
- Premium puzzle packs

## Performance Considerations
- Efficient grid rendering for larger puzzles
- Optimized animations for lower-end devices
- Minimal network requests through caching
- Offline play capability with data synchronization

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for game logic
- Widget tests for UI components
- Integration tests for Firebase connectivity
